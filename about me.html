    <P><strong> My Life and Things I Like:</strong> Hi there! My name is Samreen Malik and I'm the creator of this website! I'm 16 years old and I'm a grade 11 student attending T.L.Kennedy Secondary School. 
      I was born and raised in Toronto, but my family were immigrants from Pakistan, and came to Canada in 1998. 
      I love drawing/painting, listening to music, playing video games, and playing sports such as basketball and sometimes soccer! 
      I also love animals, especially my pet cat named Coco! She's a calico and is absolutely adorable! Something I really enjoy doing is gardening and planting flowers! 
      I really love flowers and how beautiful and serene they are! My favourite flowers though are cherry blossoms! 
      My favourite subjects in school are Science, Visual Arts, English, and Physical Education! 
      I'm also a member of ICT SHSM along with some of my friends at school! </P>

  <p><strong>My Future Ambitions:</strong> My plan after graduating highschool is to go to university to study graphic design or animation! One of my options is to study animation at OCAD university, one of the best art schools in Canada. 
    This is because my dream job when I'm older is to become an animator. 
    As a child, I've always enjoyed watching cartoons and animated movies, especially ones made in Japan. 
    It's very nostalgic to look back at my old drawings and movies I would record movies and television shows on my parent's VHS cassettes. 
    It reminds me of the time that I would dream of making the same movies and cartoons I would watch on TV. 
    Becoming an animator has and always will be an ambition of mine! I believe that taking this computer science course will not only help me in persuing
    my future career, but also give me a good background knowledge of computer software and programming!</p>
