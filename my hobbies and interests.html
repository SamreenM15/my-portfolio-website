<h1>❀My Hobbies and Interests❀</h1>

<h3> There are many things that I am passionate about and interested in. 
    One of the things I am most passionate about is art! 
    I love drawing and painting pictures of my favourite cartoon characters, and even original characters I come up with on my own! 
    I mostly draw digitally on my tablet, but I also enjoy making traditional sketches and paintings in my sketchbook! Some mediums I love to use when 
    creating art pieces are alcohol-based markers, watercolours and acrylic paints, and graphite pencils. Another interest of mine that I am quite passionate about is basketball! Basketball has been a favourite sport of mine since I was 4
     years old. I love playing with my brother and sister on the weekends when it's nice and sunny outside! 
    Because they are more experienced than I am, they help me practice with my shooting and ball handeling. 
    My favourite basketball players are Chris Bosh, Michael Jordan, and Kobe Bryant! Sometimes when the weather isn't so great and I have to stay indoors, I like to curl up and read a good book! 
    I mostly enjoy reading fictional novels, as well as Japanese mangas! My most favourite books have to be "The Outsiders" by S.E Hinton, The Harry Potter series by J.K Rowling, and the Japanese manga series "Slam Dunk" by Inoue Takehiko.
    I could list even more of my favourite novels but that would be too much to take in. (>_<)

<p>"The Outsiders" by S.E Hilton is about a teen gang in rural Oklahoma, the Greasers who are perpetually at odds with the Socials, their rival gang. 
  When two young Greasers named Ponyboy and Johnny get into a brawl that ends in the death of a Social member, 
  the boys are forced to leave home and go into hiding. Soon Ponyboy and Johnny, along with the intense Dallas, 
  and their other Greaser buddies, must contend with the consequences of their violent lives.</p>
<center><img src="../images/harry potter book cover.jpeg"></center>
<p>The main character in this novel series is Harry Potter, a boy who lives in the fictional town of Little Whinging, Surrey 
with his aunt, uncle, and cousin (the Dursleys), and discovers at the age of eleven that he is a wizard, 
though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles to the wizarding world. The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, 
hidden and in secrecy. Harry is born with magical abilities, and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills 
to succeed in the wizarding world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a wizarding academy in Scotland, 
and it is here where most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social, and emotional, 
including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself 
for the confrontation that lies ahead in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.<p>

<p>The "Slam Dunk" manga series starts off with our main character Hanamichi Sakuragi, a delinquent and the leader of a gang. Sakuragi is very unpopular with girls, having been rejected an astonishing fifty times. In his first year at Shohoku High School, 
  he meets Haruko Akagi, the girl of his dreams, and is overjoyed when she is not repulsed or scared of him like all the other girls he has asked out.
  Haruko, recognizing Sakuragi's athleticism, introduces him to the Shohoku basketball team. Sakuragi is reluctant to join the team at first, 
  as he has no prior experience in sports and thinks that basketball is a game for losers because his fiftieth rejection was in favor of a basketball player. 
  Sakuragi, despite his extreme immaturity and fiery temper, proves to be a natural athlete and joins the team, mainly in the hopes of impressing and getting closer to Haruko. 
  Later on, Sakuragi realizes that he has come to actually love the sport, despite having previously played primarily because of his crush on Haruko. 
  Kaede Rukawa — Sakuragi's bitter rival (both in basketball and because Haruko has a massive one-sided crush on Rukawa) joins the team at the same time. Not long after, Hisashi Mitsui, a very skilled three-point shooter and ex-junior high school MVP (he's also my favourite character! o(^▽^)o), 
  and Ryota Miyagi, a short but fast point guard, both rejoin the team and together these four struggle to fulfill team captain Takenori Akagi's dream of winning the national championship. 
  Together, these misfits gain publicity and the once little-known Shohoku basketball team becomes an all-star contender in Japan.</p>
